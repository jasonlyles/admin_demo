# Before Launch:

* When deploying to Heroku, follow these directions:

# Longer Term:
* Maybe on a guest page, have a feature to send a follow up email.
* Work on an export to XLS feature. (It looks like this will require forking a gem and fixing it.)
* Eventually, if I get bored, I could add aasm to this project to take different
  actions or display different things when transitioning between various booking statuses:
  https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/wiki/How-to-work-with-AASM
  This would make the process easier for determining which apartments were available, available soon, etc.
* Maybe play with roles, like an admin user who can do everything, and some less-privileged
  user who can't delete records, or who can create bookings that need to be approved by a manager.
* It would be really nice if dates that weren't available for an apartment were
  grayed out when booking for a specific apartment. Might require a different calendar widget.
* Add some reports, such as monthly income.
* On the apartment index page, add a scope for apartments that are available now, and
maybe for ones that will be available in the next 3 months.
